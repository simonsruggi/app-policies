## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the app work?
Spin the wheel to discover fun activity ideas for your evening! You can filter by category, budget, and distance.

### How do I manage my subscription?
Go to **Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions** on your iPhone to manage or cancel your subscription.

### How do I restore my purchases?

### Does the app use my location?
Only if you allow it — your location is used to show nearby activity suggestions and calculate distances. It's processed entirely on your device and never sent to any server.

All data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the app removes all your data (favorites, custom ideas, preferences).
