# Privacy Policy — FarmaStock

**Last updated:** February 19, 2026

## Overview

FarmaStock ("the App") is developed by Simone Ruggiero. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.

## Data Collection

FarmaStock does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

All data — including scanned products, inventory, and expiry dates — is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework.

## Camera Usage

The App uses your device's camera exclusively to:
- Scan product barcodes (EAN/UPC codes)
- Read expiry dates via OCR (optical character recognition)

Camera data is processed entirely on-device and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

### Open Food Facts API
When you scan a barcode that is not found in the local database, the App queries the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) database to retrieve product information (name, description, category). **Only the barcode number is sent** — no personal or device data is transmitted.

### RevenueCat
Used to manage premium subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect:
- Anonymous device identifier
- Purchase and subscription history
- Country/region (derived from App Store)

No personal information (name, email, health data) is shared with RevenueCat. For more details, see the [RevenueCat Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

### Apple StoreKit
Used for in-app subscription processing. All payment data is handled directly by Apple and is governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Notifications

The App may send local notifications to remind you of upcoming product expiry dates. These notifications are generated entirely on-device and are not sent through any external server.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any personal or health-related user data to third parties. The only data transmitted externally is:
- **Barcode numbers** → to Open Food Facts (for product lookup)
- **Anonymous purchase data** → to RevenueCat (for subscription management)

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
