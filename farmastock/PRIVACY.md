# Privacy Policy — FarmaStock

**Last updated:** February 18, 2026

## Overview

FarmaStock ("the App") is developed by Simone Ruggiero. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.

## Data Collection

FarmaStock does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

All data — including scanned products, inventory, and expiry dates — is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework.

## Camera Usage

The App uses your device's camera exclusively to:
- Scan product barcodes (EAN/UPC codes)
- Read expiry dates via OCR (optical character recognition)

Camera data is processed entirely on-device and is never recorded, stored, or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

- **Open Food Facts API**: When you scan a barcode, the App may query the Open Food Facts database to retrieve product information (name, brand, image). Only the barcode number is sent — no personal data.
- **RevenueCat**: Used to manage premium subscriptions. RevenueCat may collect anonymous purchase data as described in their [privacy policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).
- **Apple StoreKit**: Used for in-app subscription processing, governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Notifications

The App may send local notifications to remind you of upcoming product expiry dates. These notifications are generated entirely on-device and are not sent through any external server.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
